# IndustrialLLM
## Overview
This dataset is developed to provide high-quality training and testing data for GUI Agents in the era of Large Language Models (LLMs). It is specifically designed to bridge the gap between human-computer interaction and intelligent agent capabilities, focusing on realistic and high-impact industrial applications.

Our documentation and data are industrial-grade, covering a diverse range of scenarios that are either already deployed or have the potential for large-scale adoption in the Smart Industry era. These include domains such as robotic arm planning, industrial welding, chemical synthesis, and network hardware configuration.

We have captured screen recordings of human interactions with industrial software interfaces across these scenarios. Each video is precisely synchronized at the video frame level with corresponding user input events (e.g., mouse, keyboard), offering a fine-grained view of human actions during real-world task execution.

To help users better understand the dataset, we provide illustrative visualizations that summarize key statistics and data distributions:
