Manually adjust the motion planning of the robotic arm: Set goal state of "panda_joint7" to 40 degree; Set goal state of "panda_joint6" to 117 degree; Set goal state of "panda_joint5" to 0 degree; Set goal state of "panda_joint4" to minus 39 degree; Set goal state of "panda_joint3" to 3 degree; Set goal state of "panda_joint2" to 15 degree; Set goal state of "panda_joint1" to 10 degree; Set goal state of "panda_joint3" to 3 degree; Set goal state of "panda_joint2" to 10 degree and then 21 degree; Set goal state of "panda_joint4" to minus 70 degree; Set goal state of "panda_joint5" to 7 degree; Set goal state of "panda_joint6" to 100 degree; Set goal state of "panda_joint7" to minus 11 degree; Set the start state of the robotic arm to "<same as goal>" and finally execute the command "Plan".
